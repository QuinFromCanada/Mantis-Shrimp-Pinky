## Description:

<img src="/Images/Toolhead.jpg" width=300>


I love the design however, I had issues printing with ABS using the Dragon Toolhead.
My theory was that this was caused by the air from the hotend fan blowing across the top of the heat block.
So I redesigned the Cage (Mantis-Shrimp_Pinky Body - Alternate for Phaetus Dragon Hotend for ABS printing).

The rest of the project uses Pinky's files.

I Remade the Design in FreeCAD - Realthunder Branch  https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases because I love FreeCAD and I wanted a model with more freedom to modify key features down the road.
