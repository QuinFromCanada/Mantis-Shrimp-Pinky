## Description:

I made these Simulations in order to help me optimize airflow for this project.  They are available to the public at https://www.simscale.com/projects/quinfromcanada/mantis_shrimp_-_copy/

My hope here is that someone finds this interesting.

This is how Airflow travels from the parts cooling fan on the OG design when you use a Dragon Toolhead with them.  As you can see some of the airflow fromt eh fan flows across the top of the heater block, reducing its ability to heat the fillament.

In my design I moved the fan up, dropped the hot end down and, added a skirt to prevent drafts from hitting the top of the heater block. This increases the ability to heat.
